# Tic Tac Toe
This is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python, developed as part of CS50AI's Project0.

# Features
The game offers a simple command-line interface and allows for two human players to play against each other.

# How to Play
To start a new game, run the following command:

```python runner.py```

The game will then ask for the name of the two players, and will randomly assign X or O to each player. Players can take turns entering the coordinates of the cell they want to mark, using the following format: row,column (e.g. "1,2" corresponds to the second cell of the first row). The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full.

# Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

* `runner.py`: the main file that runs the game
* `tictactoe.py`: the implementation of the game logic and board state
* `player.py`: the definition of the Player class used to represent the human players
$ `README.md`: this file

# Dependencies
The game requires Python 3.x to be installed on the system. No additional packages are needed.

# Contributing
Contributions to the game are welcome! If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
